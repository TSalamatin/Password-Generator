This week we are to take some HTML and CSS and make a functional random password generator together. It will Prompt the user if the way the following options in order: Number of characters, Uppercase Characters, Lowercase Characters, Special Characters, then Numbers. The script will not accept any values below 8, above 128, null, or otherwise non-numeric characters as an input.
